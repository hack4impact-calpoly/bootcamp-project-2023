                    <p className= {style.content}>Hi! My name is Winnie Trinh, and I am a <em>first year Computer Science major</em> at <strong>Cal Poly 
                    SLO</strong>. My hobbies are mastering the skill of doing my nails, working out, going on hikes, and hanging
                        out with my friends. I also love trying new things or opportunities that take me out of my comfort zone! 
                        Nothing too athletic though...like long distance running...
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        This quarter, I strive to make new friends, connections, and thrive in the classes I'm most interested/engaged 
                        in such as my Calculas and Data Structures class.
