        The restaurant exudes a casual and intimate atmosphere, enhanced by
        decor inspired by Vietnam's enchanting landscapes - rustic wooden
        fixtures, intricately woven bamboo, and vivid murals reflecting the
        bustling street markets of Hanoi and the tranquil beauty of the Mekong
        Delta.
