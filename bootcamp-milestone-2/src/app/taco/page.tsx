        Cholita Linda came after years of training, cooking, and traveling, and
        was borne from a desire to cook the food I grew up eating, with
        everything made by hand fresh each day, and with plenty of love. Our
        philosophy at Cholita Linda is to have fresh, vibrant food that not only
        tastes of Latin America but speaks to its tradition, its culture, and
        its warmth.
