              I am a 2nd year
              <strong> Computer Science B.S.</strong> student at California
              Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. Currently, I am taking{" "}
              <em> Systems Programming (CSC 357)</em> and
              <em> Discrete Structures (CSC 248)</em>. Some relevant coursework
              I have taken in the past includes
              <em> Data Structures (CSC 202)</em> and
              <em> Project-Based Object Oriented Programming (CSC 203)</em>.
            </p>

              I am interested in learning about mobile and web development, as
              well as human-computer interaction. The field of mixed
              reality/VR/AR also excites me because of its intersection of arts
              and computing. In my spare time, I love to dance.
