            Dear reader, as you may know, my name is Xavier Garcia. This is my first blogpost on my personal website 
            that I have been curating for <em>Hack4Impact,</em> and I will use this post as an introduction to 
            this Blog page. I am beginning Bootcamp for new Hack4Impact members, and as part of the program, I have learned
            how to dynamically update my website by appending to the DOM using TypeScript. Expect to see more posts from 
            me in the future!
