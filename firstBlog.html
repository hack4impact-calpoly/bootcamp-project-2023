            Week 4 of my third year at Cal Poly is coming to an end, but I still have classes tomorrow. I am excited to
            attend my first Hack4Impact bootcamp session in about an hour and a half. I want to learn more Languages
            and programming practices through this bootcamp, and I am eager to get to work on helping non-profits. I am 
            looking forward to attending Culturefest Saturday, and I can't wait to get some much needed rest this weekend.
