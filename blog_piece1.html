                        This is an introductory blog post with plenty of styling to come! For now, here's what I can tell you.
                        The origin of this photo is from two weeks ago, where my roommates and I headed to Pirates Cove for the first time.
                        The view <em>obviously</em> was marvelous so I had to take a photo. Enjoy!
