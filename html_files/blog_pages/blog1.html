        <p class="blog-caption">
          This weekend my dad flew out from Denver to come visit me for the
          weekend. Though it was only for three days we made the most of it. On
          saturday we went to High Street Deli for lunch, before going to a
          tailgate at my fraternity's main house. After a disappointing CalPoly
          football game, we managed to get a table at Flour House and had a
          delicious pizza dinner. On sunday morning, I picked my dad up and we
          made our way to Pismo Beach for a surf day. My dad brought his 20 year
          old wetsuit from his days in the Navy and it was pretty amusing. The
          waves were perfect for two Coloradoans, with gentle rolling breaks
          that allowed people of our skill level to attempt the larger swells.
          After surfing we refueled with burritos from Taqueria San Miguel, then
          booked a 2:55 tee time at Morro Bay Golf Course. It was an action
          packed weekend and I look forward to the next visit from my dad!
