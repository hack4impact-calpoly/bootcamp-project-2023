However, I ended up in a great Wow group as I made a new friend and found an old friend from high school. My Wow leaders were also the best people I could ask for. I am extremely grateful for the amount of work and dedication they put into making the first week fun and entertaining. <br> By the end of the week, I no longer felt super awkward and lost. I had gained a friend and got more comfortable with talking to everyone. It was super fun getting many opportunities to explore the campus as well as places off-campus such as downtown and hikes. I even pledged for the Fraternity that both my Wow leaders are in!",
