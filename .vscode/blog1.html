        My first day of SLO Days had started out rough. There was a lot of traffic and 
          construction sites on the way to Cal Poly from where I live. I was also driving
          and the drive is a little over 3 hours long. I ended up being 20 minutes late to 
          the first event and was about to fall asleep the entire day. Overall, the day was
          hot and I was not in a social mood nor was I in the mood to sit through a bunch
          of presentations.

          SLO Days ended short for me and my friends. We left to grab breakfast and headed
          home early. I couldn't take it anymore. On the way back home, my car had an issue.
          My tires were losing air pressure and I was confused as to why that is. We believe
          it must've been the change in temperature that made my car tires lose so much pressure.
          That was the day me and my friends learned how to insert air into car tires at a gas
          station. Even then, it didn't work that well and I had to visit my car dealership back
          at home to situate my car.
