                    <p class ="project-description"> At the end of this summer, I finished up my SWE Internship at Wells Fargo - 
                        It was an amazing experience getting to work on the full stack with my team members, 
                        and connecting with employees and other interns.

                        This summer I was tasked with developing a web app for our business teams 
                        that was able to cut their execution time almost in half! I was able to make their 
                        requests into reality and got to problem solve independently. I greatly improved the 
                        range and depth of my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, .NET and SQL. 
                        Not only did I improve my coding skills, but got to further experience working in industry.
                        
                        Special thanks to my manager Habib Yaghoubi and my teammates Marc 
                        and CJ for all your support, and Tali Bray for taking the time to get to know the interns!
