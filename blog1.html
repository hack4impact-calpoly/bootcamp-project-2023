                    <p class ="project-description">I finished my internship at 
                        Microchip Technology Inc. last Friday! It was an extremely
                         rewarding summer spent gaining real-world experience 
                         working in Silicon Valley.</p>

                        <p>I have been blessed with a wealth of knowledge and 
                            experience that I can attribute to the projects and 
                            people I worked with. I authored a published application
                             note on NTP Time Server Configuration for their 
                             industry-leading, ultra-precise time synchronization 
                             device, which is available on the Microchip website 
                             (linked below). Alongside this, I applied my academic 
                             knowledge to software development projects; from writing
                              automated testing phases to ensure firmware image 
                              validity to enhancing data visualization software 
                              used by the company, 'Time Monitor Analyzer.' I am 
                              grateful to the inspiring and dedicated software 
                              developers, Eric Ivanov and Lee Cosart, for their 
                              guidance on these projects.</p>
                        
                        <p>I'd like to thank my mentor, Paul Skoog, for all he 
                            taught me, and my manager, Barry Dropping, for his 
                            continuous support. :) Special thanks to Brianna 
                            Casarez for her work on the HR front! This 
                            internship has been pivotal for my transition from 
                            student to professional software engineer in the 
                            coming year.</p>
