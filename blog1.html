                    So how did my first Hack4Impact project go? I would say
                    <em>pretty</em> well! There were a few times where I struggled, such
                    as when I was trying to commit to my own personal repository. I think
                    I had such a hard time, because in my CSC 357 class this year my
                    teacher made us create a SSH for GitHub. As a result, when I tried to
                    commit to the repository, it didn't let me, because I wasn't using a
                    key. Other than that, though, everything when smoothly and I had a
                    great time designing this website!
