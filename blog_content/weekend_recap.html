                This weekend was pretty chill. On Saturday,
                 I started my day with a refreshing hike up Bishops.
                    For linner (lunch and dinner) I went out to Papa's Thai
                   in downtown with friends for some delicious dumplings and fried bananas.
                    I then made my way over to my friend's apartment for his
                     birthday party-- super fun. Today (Sunday), I hiked the serenity swing trail, and lw almost died.
                      I then spent the rest of the day catching up on work and mentally preparing for the horrendous
                       week I have ahead of me :/
