                It's Friday! My favorite day of the weekend. Weather today was super nice,
                 I love hot and sunny days. I had two classes today so got down with school pretty early
                 in the day thank god. Coming back from class I picked up some bananas from the campus market
                 and made myself a peanut butter banana sandwhich (but instead of bread I used Greek pita).
                 I then met with some friends for a house show in Pismo. The genre of music the band at the house show
                 was playing was definetely quite interesting haha-- it is always super fun to watch and discover local 
                 small bands in SLO. Lastly, I ended the night with some delicious dumplings from Trader Joe's!
